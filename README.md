As you will be speaking at the internal sales meeting you should prepare a brief text to read out. 2-3 paragraphs are sufficient and given it is an informal meeting there is no need for any plots or other media.The Citi economist will be present at the meeting to discuss the internal Citi research view and the associate on your desk is in charge of outlining the sales desks view so you should stick to summarizing the external information.
Overnight Recap: Keep this relatively brief as the focus of the day will be on the FOMC meeting. While there are obviously many currencies throughout Asia and Europe given the focus on the FOMC it is best to focus primarily on the moves in USD rates during these sessions. However, if you believe some of the moves in other markets such as AUD or EUR are particularly relevant feel free to mention them.
Outline the economic setting in terms of the recent key economic data. Provide a brief recap of what happened at the previous meeting. Outline the overall market consensus about what is expected at this meeting. Once youâ€™re happy with your summary please submit the text. Note that while you are going to present your summary at the sales meeting, it should not be written as a speech/presentation and you should think of this as more of an informal report/email.
